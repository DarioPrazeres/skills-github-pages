## Algorithmic complexity 
Algorithmic complexity refers to the efficiency of an algorithm in terms of the resources it consumes. There are two main types of complexity:

1. Time Complexity: This measures the amount of time an algorithm takes to complete as a function of the size of the input. It provides an upper bound on the actual running time.

2. Space Complexity: This measures the amount of memory space an algorithm requires as a function of the size of the input. It provides an upper bound on the total memory space used by the algorithm.

3. Programmers and computer scientists analyze the time and space complexity of algorithms to understand how their performance scales with increasing input sizes. This analysis helps in choosing the most efficient algorithms for a given problem.
